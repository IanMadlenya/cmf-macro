> Macroeconometricians do four things: describe and summarize macroeconomic
> data, make macroeconomic forecasts, quantify what we do or do not know about the true
> structure of the macroeconomy, and advise (and sometimes become) macroeconomic
> policymakers. In the 1970s, these four tasks – data description, forecasting, structural
> inference, and policy analysis – were performed using a variety of techniques.

> A researcher might/should be interested in diagnostic tests, such as testing for the absence of
> autocorrelation, heteroscedasticity or non-normality in the error process. He might be interested
> further in causal inference, forecasting and/or diagnosing the empirical model’s dynamic
> behavior, i.e., impulse response functions (henceforth: IRF) and forecast error variance decomposition
> (henceforth: FEVD).
